# LinkNYC Kiosk Map

This project is an interactive map built with Mapbox GL JS that visualizes LinkNYC public Wi-Fi kiosk locations across New York City. Users can explore and filter LinkNYC types (LinkNYC1.0 and Link5G), search by address, and view detailed information about each kiosk ‚Äî including type and location.

## Dataset Information

As of May 11, 2025, this project uses the most up-to-date LinkNYC kiosk dataset available.

Due to the NYC Open Data API limiting results to 1,000 records, the full dataset was manually downloaded and saved as a CSV on May 11, 2025. It is hosted directly in this GitHub repository:

üìÅ LinkNYC_Kiosk_Locations_20250426.csv

This ensures that the map accurately reflects all kiosk locations across New York City without API limitations or missing records.
