# LinkNYC Kiosk Map

This project is an interactive map built with Mapbox GL JS that visualizes LinkNYC public Wi-Fi kiosk locations across New York City. Users can explore and filter LinkNYC types (LinkNYC1.0 and Link5G), search by address, and view detailed information about each kiosk ‚Äî including type and location.

## Dataset Information

As of May 11, 2025, this map uses a static dataset hosted on GitHub:
üìÅ LinkNYC_Kiosk_Locations_20250426.csv

Due to the NYC Open Data API limiting responses to 1,000 records, the full dataset was manually downloaded and uploaded to this project. This ensures that all available kiosks are shown on the map without pagination or API query limits.
